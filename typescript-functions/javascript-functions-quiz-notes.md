## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a reusable block of code that does a specific task or makes calculations for you
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  name, parameters, code block
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  what calls the function, a dot(.), name of the function, parenthasees ( () ), and arguments delimited by a comma(,) inside those parenthasees
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a function call is when you are executing the function with arguments passed in to it(optional), a function definition is whan you create the function and define what it does and what parameters it takes
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are in your function definition they tell you what your function can take in as arguments. Arguments are when you call your function, they are the actual variables or data that are being passed into the function to be executed the arguments may be referenced or manipulated during the execution of the function
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  they are useful because they allow your function to be executed with arguments passed into them, allowing your function to manipulate or reference data for its execution which can help it do specific tasks you want it to

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  it gives the output of some value based on whatever is returned in the return statement instead of the default undefined that is returned from functions that have no return statement. It stops any other code from the code block of our function from being run

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  (parameter1, parameter2) =>{ //code block}
  parenthasees with parameters inside delimited by a comma, equals sign followed by greater than sign (=>), curly braces({}) with code block inside

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  it has an implcit return, so it can return a value without having a return statement
